## 2024-05-18 - Caching D-Bus System Connection

**Learning:** Recreating `zbus::Connection::system().await` per D-Bus proxy call introduces significant and unnecessary IPC overhead (DBus handshake + socket creation), degrading performance especially in UI applications that poll statuses or interact frequently with system daemons.
**Action:** Use `tokio::sync::OnceCell` to instantiate the global D-Bus connection once during startup and clone it for subsequent proxy object initializations. Always verify that system/IPC connections are reused appropriately, preventing connection bloat and reducing latency.
