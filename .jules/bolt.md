**Learning:** Recreating `zbus::Connection::system().await` per D-Bus proxy call introduces significant and unnecessary IPC overhead (DBus handshake + socket creation), degrading performance especially in UI applications that poll statuses or interact frequently with system daemons.
**Action:** Use `tokio::sync::OnceCell` to instantiate the global D-Bus connection once during startup and clone it for subsequent proxy object initializations. Always verify that system/IPC connections are reused appropriately, preventing connection bloat and reducing latency.
## 2024-05-30 - Optimize D-Bus Connection Caching
**Learning:** Re-establishing the D-Bus connection for `is_running` polling and other backend operations introduces unnecessary IPC overhead.
**Action:** The backend connection `zbus::Connection` can be cached instead of recreating it upon every `get_proxy()` request.
## 2024-05-30 - Optimize D-Bus Proxy Caching
**Learning:** Re-establishing the D-Bus `DaemonProxy` per operation (e.g. `is_running`) even when using a cached connection still introduces significant runtime overhead due to proxy object recreation.
**Action:** The backend connection `DaemonProxy` itself can be cached entirely via `tokio::sync::OnceCell` in `CoreBackend`, completely eliminating repeated creation overhead for standard IPC calls.
## 2024-05-10 - Cache DaemonProxy for efficient D-Bus calls
**Learning:** Initializing `DaemonProxy::new(&conn)` for zbus creates internal overhead. Even when the `zbus::Connection` itself is globally cached, repeatedly creating new proxy instances across different parts of the application (like log windows and backend status polling) leads to unnecessary memory and processing cost.
**Action:** `zbus` proxies use internal Arcs, meaning they are extremely cheap to clone once instantiated. Cache them globally using `tokio::sync::OnceCell` (similar to connections) to ensure only one instance is created per application lifecycle and simply cloned where needed.
