## 2024-05-18 - Caching D-Bus System Connection

**Learning:** Recreating `zbus::Connection::system().await` per D-Bus proxy call introduces significant and unnecessary IPC overhead (DBus handshake + socket creation), degrading performance especially in UI applications that poll statuses or interact frequently with system daemons.
**Action:** Use `tokio::sync::OnceCell` to instantiate the global D-Bus connection once during startup and clone it for subsequent proxy object initializations. Always verify that system/IPC connections are reused appropriately, preventing connection bloat and reducing latency.
## 2024-05-30 - Optimize D-Bus Connection Caching
**Learning:** Re-establishing the D-Bus connection for `is_running` polling and other backend operations introduces unnecessary IPC overhead.
**Action:** The backend connection `zbus::Connection` can be cached instead of recreating it upon every `get_proxy()` request.
## 2024-05-30 - Optimize D-Bus Proxy Caching
**Learning:** Re-establishing the D-Bus `DaemonProxy` per operation (e.g. `is_running`) even when using a cached connection still introduces significant runtime overhead due to proxy object recreation.
**Action:** The backend connection `DaemonProxy` itself can be cached entirely via `tokio::sync::OnceCell` in `CoreBackend`, completely eliminating repeated creation overhead for standard IPC calls.
## 2024-05-30 - Optimize HTTP Client Caching
**Learning:** Instantiating a new `reqwest::Client` on every `DaemonClient::new()` request (which occurs frequently during polling and status updates) destroys the internal connection pool and incurs severe initialization overhead, drastically limiting network throughput to the local daemon.
**Action:** Cache the `reqwest::Client` instance globally (e.g. using `std::sync::OnceLock`) inside `DaemonClient::new()`. Since the client uses an internal `Arc`, cloning it is extremely cheap and properly shares the single underlying connection pool across the application.
